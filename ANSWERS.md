- [x] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

* [x] Describe Middleware?
      Middleware is code proccessed in between your api request and it's response. It allows you to manipulate the data before it is returned from the server

* [x] Describe a Resource?
      Anything that can be accessed and returned through the associated api

* [x] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
      A status code

* [x] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
      By using different routers for the data. To get a list of cars we might us the '/api/cars' route but to get motorcycles we might use '/api/motorcylces'
